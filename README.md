# BookStore Application

## Description

The BookStore application is a comprehensive project developed as part of the Spring Framework Fourth Semester UMSC Classes at my university. It aims to demonstrate the skills acquired during the course by creating a fully functional web application using various Spring technologies. The project includes features such as user registration, login, session management, and an admin panel for managing the application.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Allows users to create accounts and securely log in.
- **Spring Security Roles Management:** Different roles (e.g., User, Admin) with specific access rights.
- **Session Management:** Maintains user session information securely.
- **Admin Panel:** Allows admin users to manage the application, including user management and order processing.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add books to a cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders, and the application manages the order process end-to-end.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Framework:** Core framework for developing the application.
- **Spring Security:** Manages authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Provides abstraction over the data access layer using JPA.
- **Thymeleaf:** Template engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database used for storing application data.
